# Feature Workflow - Compact Reference
# Features = GitHub issue-driven work

## Feature vs Chore
feature: github-issue-driven, external-tracking, multi-session, acceptance-criteria
chore: internal-maintenance, session-only, single-session, no-issue

## Branch Patterns
feature: issue/feature-<N>/<desc>
chore: chore/<desc>
mapping: 1-issue = 1-branch = 1-session = 1-metadata

## Session Naming
feature: <N>-<desc>.md
chore: chore-<desc>.md
example: 10-d365-performance-tools.md | chore-document-feature-workflow.md

## Commit Format
feature: "#<N> - verb desc" (github-auto-links)
chore: "chore - verb desc"
bullets: - change1, - change2
format: HEREDOC (required)
never: attribution, emojis, AI-mentions

## Metadata Fields (features only)
issue: <number>
type: issue
session: <N>-<desc>.md
status: planning, in-progress, testing, pr-created, completed, blocked
github-url: documented-in-session

## Session Structure (features)
sections: |
  Issue Details (number, title, created, status, url)
  Objective
  Requirements (core-components, key-features)
  Technical Approach
  Implementation Plan (phased-checklist)
  Dependencies
  Success Criteria
  Session Log (timestamped-entries)
  Key Decisions (rationale, impact, alternatives)
  Learnings (categorized-insights)
  Files Created (by-type)
  Next Steps (prioritized)
size: 100-300 lines (detailed)
vs-chore: 30-80 lines (focused)

## Session Log Pattern
format: |
  ### YYYY-MM-DD - Activity Title
  **Actions:**
  1. action1
  2. action2

  **Key findings:**
  - finding1
  - finding2

## Decision Documentation
format: |
  ### Decision N: Title
  **Reason**: rationale
  **Impact**: impact
  **Alternative**: alternative-considered

## Auto-Detection
flow: git-branch → sanitize → .claude/branches/<sanitized> → session-file
example: issue/feature-10/xyz → issue-feature-10-xyz → 10-xyz.md

## Workflow Differences
|                  | Feature              | Chore                |
|------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| github-issue     | yes                  | no                   |
| commit-prefix    | #N -                 | chore -              |
| session-naming   | N-desc.md            | chore-desc.md        |
| scope            | multi-session        | single-session       |
| external-track   | github               | internal             |
| acceptance       | issue-criteria       | session-criteria     |

## Creation Checklist (features)
1-create: github-issue (document-requirements)
2-branch: issue/feature-N/desc (from-main)
3-metadata: .claude/tools/create-branch-metadata.sh
4-session: populate-from-issue (objective, requirements, approach)
5-commit: atomic (session+code), format: #N -

## Testing Strategy
feature: phased-testing, integration-after-each-phase
chore: conditional-testing (shellcheck-if-bash)

## Quality Patterns
session-richness: detailed-decisions-and-learnings (features) vs focused-execution (chores)
commit-frequency: after-each-milestone (features) vs after-completion (chores)
pr-description: maps-to-issue-acceptance-criteria (features) vs describes-changes (chores)
