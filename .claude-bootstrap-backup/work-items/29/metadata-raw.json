GitHub API integration - fetch issue details\n2. Azure DevOps API integration - fetch work item details  \n3. Auto-detect issue/work-item from branch name\n4. Auto-populate session from issue/work-item\n5. Bidirectional sync (session ↔ work item)\n\n### Key Features\n- **Auto-detection**: Extract issue number from branch name\n- **Auto-fetch**: Retrieve issue/work-item details via API\n- **Auto-populate**: Create session file from issue data\n- **Bidirectional sync**: Update issue when session updates, vice versa\n- **Multi-platform**: Support both GitHub and Azure DevOps\n\n## Technical Approach\n\n### 1. Issue Detection (First Priority)\nCreate skill/command to detect issue from branch:\n- Parse branch name (e.g., `issue/feature-24/session-enforcement` → #24)\n- Support both GitHub and Azure DevOps patterns\n- Validate issue exists and is accessible\n\n### 2. GitHub API Integration (Second Priority)\nFetch issue details:\n- Use `gh api` command (already available)\n- Extract: title, body, labels, milestone, assignee\n- Map to session structure\n\n### 3. Auto-Populate Session (Third Priority)  \nCreate session from issue:\n- Map issue title → session title\n- Map issue body → objectives/requirements\n- Add issue metadata (number, URL, status)\n- Create initial session log entry\n\n### 4. Azure DevOps Integration (Fourth Priority)\nFetch work item details:\n- Use Azure CLI or REST API\n- Extract: title, description, acceptance criteria, state\n- Map to session structure\n\n### 5. Bidirectional Sync (Fifth Priority)\nKeep session and issue in sync:\n- Session update → comment on issue\n- Issue update → alert in session\n- Status sync (session complete → close issue)\n\n## Success Criteria\n- ✅ Auto-detects issue from branch name\n- ✅ Fetches issue details from GitHub/Azure DevOps\n- ✅ Auto-populates session from issue\n- ✅ Bidirectional sync working\n- ✅ Zero manual session initialization required\n\n## Notes\n\n**Focus on GitHub first** - Most common use case. Azure DevOps second.\n\n**Testing approach**: Integration testing with real GitHub issues and Azure DevOps work items.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/flexion/claude-domestique/issues/29/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/flexion/claude-domestique/issues/29/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
