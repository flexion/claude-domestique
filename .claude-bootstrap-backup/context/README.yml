# .claude/context Format Guide - Compact Reference

## Reading Compact YAML
patterns:
  flow: "→" (bootstrap → develop → transition → dogfood)
  priority: ">" (integration > unit)
  list: commas (test: commands, skills, hooks)
  alternatives: "|" (chore/desc | chore-desc)
  negation: "no:", "skip:", "never:"
  inline-examples: parens (branch: pattern (example: chore/implement-phase-1))

interpret:
  "test: a, b, c": test ALL of these
  "skip: x, y, z": don't test ANY of these
  "a > b > c": priority order (a highest)
  "a → b → c": flow/sequence (a to b to c)
  "a | b": either is valid

## Writing Compact YAML
do: shortest-phrasing, no-articles, operators (→ > |), key:value, one-fact-per-line
dont: prose, explanations, complete-sentences, markdown-formatting, redundancy

size-targets:
  simple: 5-12 lines
  config: 10-20 lines
  max: 30 lines

## Transformation Example
before-md: "## Testing\n**CRITICAL**: Test incrementally...\n- Why: catches bugs early\n- How: write tests after each function\n[100+ more lines]"
after-yml: "when: after-implementation\nstrategy: integration-testing\ntest: commands, skills, hooks\nskip: unit-tests"
reduction: 98%

## Update Process
1-read: understand current structure
2-find-key: update value (no duplicates)
3-keep-format: match existing style
4-verify: count lines/words, stay compact

## Purpose
for: claude (machine-optimized, fast parsing, minimal tokens)
not-for: humans (use DESIGN.md, IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md for docs)
benefit: 89% token reduction
