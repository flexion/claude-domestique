# AI-managed context file - optimized for token efficiency
# To modify: describe changes to Claude in natural language
#
# Work Item Integration - Compact Reference
# For patterns and examples, see: work-items.md
# For git conventions (commit/branch/PR formats), see: git.yml

## WORK ITEM AWARENESS
detect: branch-name-first (issue/feature-N, PROJ-123, #N)
inject: session-start (full-context), prompt (status-line)
platforms: github-issues, jira, azure-devops

## GIT CONVENTIONS
# Commit, branch, and PR formats are defined in git.yml (single source of truth)
# This file focuses on work-item-specific integration
see: git.yml (commit-format, branch-naming, pr-format)

## WORK ITEM LIFECYCLE
branch-checkout: status → "In Progress"
pr-created: status → "In Review"
pr-merged: status → "Done"
comments: milestone-updates, blockers, decisions

## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
track: checkbox-list (from issue description)
validate: before-commit (did-we-address-this?)
warn: unaddressed-criteria (before PR)
format: "- [ ] criterion" → "- [x] criterion" (when done)

## SESSION INTEGRATION
with-memento: populate-session-from-issue
with-mantra: refresh-issue-context-periodically
shared-convention: issue-N → branch → metadata → session

## MULTI-PLATFORM CONSIDERATIONS
github: simplest, #N references, labels
jira: customizable-fields, status-transitions, sprints
azure: work-item-types, state-management, iterations
abstraction: unified-issue-interface (platform-agnostic)

## COMMIT DISCIPLINE
staged-changes: detect-and-suggest-message
frequency: logical-units (not-too-big, not-too-small)
structure: single-purpose-commits
validation: lint-and-test-before-commit
